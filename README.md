This is a small cli tool to easier extract the information provided in our modules handbook. Currently I only extracted the Electrical Engineering / Information Technology (EI) handbook.

The data can be found here: [db.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KuhlTime/hsd-handbook-extractor/main/db.json)

## Execution

Run `npm install` followed by `npm start`. You are then guided through the creation of a new module.
