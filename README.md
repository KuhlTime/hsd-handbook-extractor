This is a small cli tool to easier extract the information provided in our modules handbook. Currently I only extracted the Electrical Engineering / Information Technology (EI) handbook.

The data can be found here: [hsd-ei-handbook-db.json](https://gist.github.com/KuhlTime/2c7a2ad2a5ba2f9fcf2bfc8c32297597)

## Execution

Run `npm install` followed by `npm start`. You are then guided through the creation of a new module.
